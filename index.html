            <p><strong>Full Refund on the Same Day:</strong> If a user decides to cancel their subscription on the same day of purchase, they are eligible for a full refund with no deductions.</p>

            <h3>2. Refund After the First Day</h3>
            <p>As the app provides access to all features from the first day, refunds will be subject to a cumulative deduction after the first day. The deduction schedule is as follows:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Day 1:</strong> Full refund (if canceled on the same day)</li>
                <li><strong>Day 2:</strong> 200 Frw deduction</li>
                <li><strong>Day 3:</strong> 400 Frw deduction</li>
                <li><strong>Day 4:</strong> 800 Frw deduction</li>
                <li><strong>Day 5:</strong> 1600 Frw deduction</li>
                <li>And so on, doubling each day.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="highlight">Refund Example:</p>
            <p>If you cancel your subscription on the third day, you will receive your subscription fee minus 400 Frw, and so on for subsequent days.</p>

            <h3>3. Conditions</h3>
            <p><strong>Final Day for Refund Eligibility:</strong> After a certain number of days (based on the subscription value), no refund will be available as the deducted amount will exceed or equal the original subscription fee.</p>
            <p><strong>Prevention of Abuse:</strong> This cumulative deduction policy is designed to prevent misuse of the refund system by users who may fully use the app's services and then claim dissatisfaction for a full refund.</p>

            <h3>4. Refund Process</h3>
            <p>To request a refund, users must contact customer support through the app’s help section. All refund requests will be processed within 3 business days.</p>
